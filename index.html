<p>Yesterday was trip day. It was okay but the guy that was doing the talking was really boring and very melo with his talking. The fun part was being with my friends and going to CookOut to eat and making it back to school during 7th period. We was to meet in the main lobby of the school after 2nd peiord. When we met in the main lobby and we had to wait for the bus and i was trying to be the first person on there so I can get my sit in the back. Even though i got my seat on the bus i ended having to share my seat with some dude. It was the worst because i am tall and i needed leg room and i couldnt get it. For the most part the bus ride wasnt all that long like i thought it was going to be. When we arrived to the spot to get off the bus i thought it was the actual place but the actual place was a few blocks down and we had to walk there. When we got a few blocks down we arrived at this huge, tall building and it turned out to be the computer place. When we got inside there was a guy and it turned out he was our tour guide. So he showed us around and stuff and as he was doing that i took a few pictures to keep for memories. When the tour we over all of us was very hungry. So we went to CookOut where i ordered a chickensandwich. It was was ok, it wasnt the best but it really didnt matter because i was starving. So we stayed there for about two hours then we loaded back up on the bus and headed back to school were i continued my day.</p>
